# API Reference

This document covers WordClaw's primary HTTP surface: the REST API. MCP is the primary agent-native companion surface; see [mcp-integration.md](../guides/mcp-integration). GraphQL remains available at `/graphql` as a compatibility layer. Experimental revenue, payout, delegation, and agent-run endpoints are intentionally hidden from the default API reference unless an operator explicitly enables those incubator modules in runtime configuration.

For deployment-level discovery before authentication, use `GET /api/capabilities`. It reports the current protocol contract, enabled modules, auth/domain expectations, and dry-run coverage in one machine-readable manifest.
