## 1. Summary
A concise overview of the proposed feature, architectural change, or improvement. This should answer "what" and "why" in a few sentences.

## 2. Motivation
Explain why we need this change. What problem does it solve? What is the expected impact on users, the system, or the business?

## 3. Proposal
Provide a high-level explanation of the proposed solution. How does it work? Include Mermaid diagrams (` ```mermaid `) when necessary to clarify complex workflows.

## 4. Technical Design (Architecture)

*   Data models / Schema changes
*   API endpoints or Middleware
*   Interfaces, classes, or modular design patterns
*   Third-party integrations

## 5. Alternatives Considered
What other approaches were evaluated? Why were they discarded in favor of this proposal? (e.g., performance, complexity, cost).

## 6. Security & Privacy Implications
Does this change introduce new vectors for attack? How is data secured? Are there L402 payment flow implications?

## 7. Rollout Plan / Milestones
Break down the implementation into phases or milestones. How will this be tested and deployed?
